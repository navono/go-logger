# go-logger

Logger interface so that your application code does not depend on the implementation.
Make sure to turn the go moudles on if you are inside the `$GOPATH`. Type the below in your terminal and press enter:

```bash
export GO111MODULE=on;
```

and for use:
```
go get github.com/navono/go-logger
```

base code initially from [amitrai48](github.com/amitrai48/logger).
